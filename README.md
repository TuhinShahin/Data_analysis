**Laptop Data Preprocessing and Analysis** 

For a Bangladeshi website : startech.com.bd
This project involves scraping laptop data from a website, preprocessing the scraped data to extract relevant features, analyzing the preprocessed data to extract insights, and interacting with a SQLite database to store and query the data.

**Overview**
The goal of this project is to gather data about laptops from an online retailer, preprocess the data to extract useful information such as specifications and prices, analyze the preprocessed data to uncover insights like popular brands and average prices, and finally store the data in a SQLite database for future use.

Components
1. Web Scraping
Utilizes BeautifulSoup and requests libraries to scrape laptop data from an online retailer.
Extracts information such as laptop descriptions, product URLs, image URLs, specifications, and prices.
2. Data Preprocessing
Extracts additional features from the specifications of each laptop, such as RAM size, storage capacity, processor type, and screen size.
Handles missing or inconsistent data gracefully using try-except blocks.
Converts prices from BDT (Bangladeshi Taka) to USD (United States Dollar) using an exchange rate.
3. Data Analysis
Analyzes the preprocessed laptop data to extract insights such as the most popular brands, average prices, and distribution of RAM and storage capacity.
Utilizes pandas library for data manipulation and analysis.
4. SQLite Database Interaction
Creates a SQLite database to store the preprocessed laptop data.
Inserts the preprocessed data into the database for persistent storage.
Provides functionality to query the database for specific information, such as laptops within a certain price range.
Usage
Web Scraping: Run the web scraping script to gather laptop data from the online retailer.
Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the scraped data to extract useful features and convert prices to USD.
Data Analysis: Analyze the preprocessed data to extract insights using pandas and other analysis tools.
SQLite Database Interaction: Create a SQLite database and insert the preprocessed data. Use SQL queries to interact with the database and retrieve information as needed.
Dependencies
